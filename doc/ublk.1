.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ublk is a utility that allows you to create, recover, view or delete user\-space block devices\&.
.PP
ublk by default comes with three different types of devices, null, loop and nbd\&.
.PP
The following commands are supported:
.SH "ADD COMMAND"
.PP
Command to add a ublk device\&.
.PP
\fB add {\-t, \-\-type} TYPE [{\-n, \-\-number} DEV_ID] [{\-q, \-\-queues} NR_HW_QUEUES] [{\-d, \-\-depth} QUEUE_DEPTH] [{\-u, \-\-uring_comp} URING_COMP] [{\-g, \-\-need\-get\-data} NEED_GET_DATA] [{\-r, \-\-user_recovery} {0|1}] [{\-i, \-\-user_recovery_reissue} {0|1}] [{\-e, \-\-user_recovery_fail_io} {0|1}] [\-\-debug_mask=0x{DBG_MASK}] [\-\-unprivileged] [\-\-usercopy] [<type specific options>] \fR
.PP
\fB\-t, \-\-type\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the type of device to create\&. The three types of supported devices are null, loop and bnd\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n, \-\-number\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-q, \-\-queue\fR
.RS 4
Number of queues to create\&. Each queue is services by a dedicated child process\&. Default is 1\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d, \-\-depth\fR
.RS 4
Maximum queue\-depthfor each queue\&. Default is 4096\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u, \-\-uring_comp\fR
.RS 4
Force to complete io cmd via io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task so that performance comparison is done easily with using task_work_add\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g, \-\-need_get_data\fR
.RS 4
User should issue io cmd again for write requests to set io buffer address and copy data from bio vectors to the userspace io buffer\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r, \-\-user_recovey\fR
.RS 4
Block devices are recoverable if ublk server exits and restarts\&. Outstanding I/O when ublk server exits is met with errors\&. I/O issued while there is no ublk server queues\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i, \-\-user_recovey_reissue\fR
.RS 4
Block devices are recoverable if ublk server exits and restarts Outstanding I/O when ublk server exits is reissued I/O issued while there is no ublk server queues
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e, \-\-user_recovey_fail_io\fR
.RS 4
Block devices are recoverable if ublk server exits and restarts Outstanding I/O when ublk server exits is met with errors I/O issued while there is no ublk server is met with errors
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug_mask\fR
.RS 4
Bitmask specifying which debug features to enable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unprivileged\fR
.RS 4
Unprivileged user can create /dev/ublkcN and /dev/ublkbN\&.
.sp
/dev/ublk\-control needs to be available for unprivileged user, and it can be done via udev rule to make all control commands available to unprivileged user\&. Except for the command of UBLK_CMD_ADD_DEV, all other commands are only allowed for the owner of the specified device\&.
.sp
When userspace sends UBLK_CMD_ADD_DEV, the device pair\*(Aqs owner_uid and owner_gid are stored to ublksrv_ctrl_dev_info by kernel, so far only the current user\*(Aqs uid/gid is stored, that said owner of the created device is always the current user\&.
.sp
We still need udev rule to apply OWNER/GROUP with the stored owner_uid and owner_gid\&.
.sp
Then ublk server can be run as unprivileged user, and /dev/ublkbN can be accessed and managed by its owner represented by owner_uid/owner_gid\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-user_copy\fR
.RS 4
Copy between request and user buffer by pread()/pwrite()
.RE
.SS "NULL"
.PP

.PP
\fB\-f, \-\-file\fR
.RS 4
File to use as backing storage for the loop device\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-buffered_io\fR
.RS 4
Use buffered i/o for accessing the backing file\&. Default is direct i/o\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-offset\fR
.RS 4
Offset skips first NUM sectors on backing file\&.

.RE
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
Show help page\&.\&.
.PP
\fB {\-v, \-\-version} \fR
.SH "RECOVERY"
.PP
There are three arguments that control how ublk will behave in case of a failure, such as crashing\&. The default behavior is no recovery and the device will fail and be removed once the target exists\&.
.PP
To enable recovery mode set "\-\-recovery 1" on the command line\&. Then instead of removing the device upon failure it will instead become inactive in a quiesced state\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In this state the block device still exists but no I/O can be performed\&.
.PP
To recover a QUIESCED device you can use the recover command:
\fB ublk recover \-n DEV_ID \fR
.PP
There are two additional flags that control how ublk will handle I/O that were in flight when a device is recovered\&.
.SS "\-\-user_recovery_reissue 1"
.PP
When the device is recovered ublk will reissue any I/O that were in flight\&.
.SS "\-\-user_recovery_fail_io 1"
.PP
When the device is recovered ublk will fail all I/O and return an error back to the application\&.
