Userspace block driver(ublk)
============================

Introduction
============

This is the userspace daemon part(ublksrv) of the ublk framework, the other
part is ``ublk driver`` [#userspace]_  which supports multiple queue.

The two parts communicate by io_uring's IORING_OP_URING_CMD with one
per-queue shared cmd buffer for storing io command, and the buffer is
read only for ublksrv, each io command can be indexed by io request tag
directly, and the command is written by ublk driver, and read by ublksrv
after getting notification from ublk driver.

For example, when one READ io request is submitted to ublk block driver, ublk
driver stores the io command into cmd buffer first, then completes one
IORING_OP_URING_CMD for notifying ublksrv, and the URING_CMD is issued to
ublk driver beforehand by ublksrv for getting notification of any new io
request, and each URING_CMD is associated with one io request by tag,
so depth for URING_CMD is same with queue depth of ublk block device.

After ublksrv gets the io command, it translates and handles the ublk io
request, such as, for the ublk-loop target, ublksrv translates the request
into same request on another file or disk, like the kernel loop block
driver. In ublksrv's implementation, the io is still handled by io_uring,
and share same ring with IORING_OP_URING_CMD command. When the target io
request is done, the same IORING_OP_URING_CMD is issued to ublk driver for
both committing io request result and getting future notification of new
io request.

So far, the ublk driver needs to copy io request pages into userspace buffer
(pages) first for write before notifying the request to ublksrv, and copy
userspace buffer(pages) to the io request pages after ublksrv handles
READ. Also looks linux-mm can't support zero copy for this case yet. [#zero_copy]_

More ublk targets will be added with this framework in future even though only
ublk-loop and ublk-null are implemented now.

libublksrv is also generated, and it helps to integrate ublk into existed
project. One example of demo_null is provided for how to make a ublk
device over libublksrv.

Quick start
===========

how to build ublksrv:
--------------------

.. code-block:: console

  autoreconf -i
  ./configure   #pkg-config and libtool is usually needed
  make

note: './configure' requires liburing 2.2 package installed, if liburing 2.2
isn't available in your distribution, please configure via the following
command, or refer to ``build_with_liburing_src`` [#build_with_liburing_src]_

.. code-block:: console

   PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${LIBURING_DIR} \
   ./configure \
    CFLAGS="-I${LIBURING_DIR}/src/include" \
    CXXFLAGS="-I${LIBURING_DIR}/src/include" \
    LDFLAGS="-L${LIBURING_DIR}/src"

and LIBURING_DIR points to directory of liburing source code, and liburing
needs to be built before running above commands. Also IORING_SETUP_SQE128
has to be supported in the liburing source.

c++20 is required for building ublk utility, but libublksrv and demo_null.c &
demo_event.c can be built independently:

- build libublksrv ::

    make -C lib/

- build demo_null && demo_event ::

    make -C lib/
    make demo_null demo_event

help
----

- ublk help

add one ublk-null disk
----------------------

- ublk add -t null


add one ublk-loop disk
----------------------

- ublk add -t loop -f /dev/vdb

or

- ublk add -t loop -f 1.img

remove one ublk disk
--------------------

- ublk del -n 0		#remove /dev/ublkb0

- ublk del -a		#remove all ublk devices

list ublk devices
---------------------

- ublk list

- ublk list -v	#with all device info dumped


unprivileged mode
==================

Typical use case is container [#stefan_container]_ in which user
can manage its own devices not exposed to other containers.

At default, controlling ublk device needs privileged user, since
/dev/ublk-control is permitted for administrator only, and this
is called privileged mode.

For unprivilege mode, /dev/ublk-control needs to be allowed for
all users, so the following udev rule need to be added:

KERNEL=="ublk-control", MODE="0666", OPTIONS+="static_node=ublk-control"

Also when new ublk device is added, we need ublk to change device
ownership to the device's real owner, so the following rules are
needed: ::

    KERNEL=="ublkc*",RUN+="ublk_chown.sh %k"
    KERNEL=="ublkb*",RUN+="ublk_chown.sh %k"

``ublk_chown.sh`` can be found under ``utils/`` too.

``utils/ublk_dev.rules`` includes the above rules.

With the above two administrator changes, unprivileged user can
create/delete/list/use ublk device, also anyone which isn't permitted
can't access and control this ublk devices(ublkc*/ublkb*)

Unprivileged user can pass '--unprevileged' to 'ublk add' for creating
unprivileged ublk device, then the created ublk device is only available
for the owner and administrator.

use unprivileged ublk in docker
-------------------------------

- install the following udev rules in host machine: ::

    ACTION=="add",KERNEL=="ublk[bc]*",RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ublk_chown_docker.sh %k 'add' '%M' '%m'"
    ACTION=="remove",KERNEL=="ublk[bc]*",RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ublk_chown_docker.sh %k 'remove' '%M' '%m'"

``ublk_chown_docker.sh`` can be found under ``utils/``.

- run one container and install ublk & its dependency packages

.. code-block:: console

  docker run \
    --name fedora \
    --hostname=ublk-docker.example.com \
    --device=/dev/ublk-control \
    --device-cgroup-rule='a *:* rmw' \
    --tmpfs /tmp \
    --tmpfs /run \
    --volume /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
    -ti \
    fedora:38

.. code-block:: console

  #run the following commands inside the above container
  dnf install -y git libtool automake autoconf g++ liburing-devel
  git clone https://github.com/ming1/ubdsrv.git
  cd ubdsrv
  autoreconf -i&& ./configure&& make -j 4&& make install

- add/delete ublk device inside container by unprivileged user

.. code-block:: console

  docker exec -u 1001:1001 -ti fedora /bin/bash

.. code-block:: console

  #run the following commands inside the above container
  bash-5.2$ ublk add -t null --unprivileged
    dev id 0: nr_hw_queues 1 queue_depth 128 block size 512 dev_capacity 524288000
    	max rq size 524288 daemon pid 178 flags 0x62 state LIVE
    	ublkc: 237:0 ublkb: 259:1 owner: 1001:1001
    	queue 0: tid 179 affinity(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 )

  bash-5.2$ ls -l /dev/ublk*

    brwx------. 1 1001 1001 259,   1 May  1 04:36 /dev/ublkb0
    crwx------. 1 1001 1001 237,   0 May  1 04:36 /dev/ublkc0

  bash-5.2$ ublk del -n 0
  bash-5.2$ ls -l /dev/ublk*
    crw-rw-rw-. 1 root root 10, 123 May  1 04:35 /dev/ublk-control

test
====

run all built tests
-------------------

make test T=all


run test group
--------------

make test T=null

make test T=loop

make test T=generic


run single test
---------------

make test T=generic/001

make test T=null/001

make test T=loop/001
...

run specified tests or test groups
----------------------------------

make test T=generic:loop/001:null


Debug
=====

ublksrv is running as one daemon process, so most of debug messages won't be
shown in terminal. If any issue is observed, please collect log via command
of "journalctl | grep ublksrvd"

``./configure --enable-debug`` can build a debug version of ublk which
dumps lots of runtime debug messages, and can't be used in production
environment, should be for debug purpose only. For debug version of
ublksrv, 'ublk add --debug_mask=0x{MASK}' can control which kind of
debug log dumped, see ``UBLK_DBG_*`` defined in include/ublksrv_utils.h
for each kind of debug log.

libublksrv API doc
==================

API is documented in include/ublksrv.h, and doxygen doc can be generated
by running 'make doxygen_doc', the generated html docs are in doc/html.

Contributing
============

Any kind of contribution is welcome!

Development is done over github.
